This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Since this is just a quick test there are some todos
TODO: 
      Could reuse the same component for all tables, but it is faster to just copy-paste the table code instead of implementing the whole componentization correctly.
      Could create a edit page using the static page and a edit button that would call the backeend to edit the object

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

Run $env:NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 on powershell so we disable certificate verification(only needed for local backend servers)
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
